// The verify-production code-work (#1530) - the I/O shell around the probes. It
// runs Action-side, which is the whole reason this task exists: an agent session
// has no egress, so a verification whose artifact is a live URL (a Pages site, a
// deployed config) can only be read from here.
//
// Four verdicts, each its own exit:
//   invalid  — the spec is unreadable: the triage marker names every problem and
//              the exit is non-zero, so the item parks with the list.
//   not-live — a liveness probe failed: print the requeue marker with
//              now + Retry-every and exit clean; the executor re-arms the item.
//   pass     — comment the evidence on the item and exit clean; the executor
//              closes it done.
//   fail     — reopen Original-issue with the evidence (the verification did its
//              job by finding the fault, which is now that issue's), link it from
//              the item, and exit clean.
