## 2026-06-18 · born · toolbar icon colored via declarativeContent (#363)
- **Reason:** a bare `hostSuffix` matcher also matches a lookalike host, and the real URL-to-icon
  match runs only inside Chrome.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** a gotcha in `docs/technicalGotchas.md`, written with the change that introduced the
  matchers.
- **Landed:** #363.

  docs, dissolved into this pack.

## 2026-07-23 · reworded · Growth dedup: prune gcec local items the canon now covers (#701)
- **Reason:** the canon chrome-extension pack now owns the raw-string `UrlFilter` match and its
  hostEquals + dot-hostSuffix fix (canon #319); kept only that the real match is exercised here
  solely by the CI-only real-Chrome test.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Opus 4.8, per the commit trailer.
- **Landed:** #701 (Refs #685).

  residue remains.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude, per the commit trailer.
- **Landed:** #802 (Refs #798).
