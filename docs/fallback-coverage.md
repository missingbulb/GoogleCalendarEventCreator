# Fallback extractor coverage

> **Auto-generated** by `test/integration/fallback-coverage.test.js` (logic in `test/fallback-coverage.js`). Do not hand-edit — it is rewritten whenever the tests run locally. See `docs/claude/testing.md`.

What the generic **fallback** extractor (`pipeline/extract-unsupported.js`) recovers on each integration-test page, compared to that page's **dedicated per-site source** — the reviewed-correct extraction the live test pins down. For every `test/integration/cases/*.json` page, `GCal.extract()` is run twice on the same cached HTML: once normally (custom) and once with the site registry emptied (fallback). We grade the fallback's **primary event** (`events[0]` after the chronological sort) field-by-field against the custom primary event, counting a field only when the custom event filled it.

`start`/`end` count as a match when the values are byte-identical **or** resolve to the same absolute instant — a dedicated source localizing to a floating time via its `ctz` is the same moment as the fallback's offset-bearing time, not a miss (see `docs/claude/testing.md`). A floating time read an hour off, or a date that dropped its time, is a real miss.

## Score

Headline coverage over all 20 cases in the corpus:

| Metric | Coverage | Hits / gradeable |
| --- | --: | --: |
| **Critical fields** (title + start + location) | **50%** | 30 / 60 |
| **All fields** | **31.7%** | 40 / 126 |
| Event coverage *(informational)* | 22.1% | 15 / 68 |

### Gate

The gate (`test/integration/fallback-coverage.baseline.json`) compares the current run to the stored watermark over the cases they **share**. A newly added case isn't in the watermark's case list, so it's excluded until the watermark is re-baselined — **adding an extractor never fails the gate**. The watermark ratchets **up** on an unchanged case set and re-anchors to the current aggregate when the set changes.

| Metric | Watermark | Current (shared) | |
| --- | --: | --: | :-: |
| Critical fields | 50% | 50% | ✓ |
| All fields | 31.7% | 31.7% | ✓ |

Gated over **20** shared case(s).

Event coverage is reported but **not gated** (a few listing pages the fallback can't enumerate dominate it).
